## Development

For adding code and making changes to files:

- Make sure you have git configured on your system.
- after you have cloned the repo, navigate to that folder.
- execute `git pull`. so that you all the files in your local system will be updated.

    ex: user1 made changes to `home.html` and he/she pushed it to the master branch. To get all the changes that user1 made,       you need to execute `git pull` so that all the changes that user1 made to `home.html` will be updated in your local system.
    
- Now that you have all the updated files, add your code to existing files or you can create new files.
- After you have done your changes, the changes you made exist only on your machine. To push them, you need to execute `git add .` which will update all the changes that you have made.
- After that you need to commit your changes. For that execute `git commit -m "a short msg to describe what changes you made"`
- Finally, you have push the code. You can do that by executing `git push origin master` and enter your credentials.
- Now, your job is done. For others to get the chages you have made, they will execute `git pull` so that all the changes that you have made will be updated in their local machine and they can see the changes.
